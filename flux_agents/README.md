# Flux Moderator Agents

This a set of agents designed to moderate content on the World of Nuclear platform.

## Motivation

Flux is a social media type of feature in the World of Nuclear. Members are allowed to post whatever they wish for all the world to see. That is great from a freedom of expression perspective. It also opens the door for abuse by trolls and other bad actors.

In the old days, companies would employ human moderators to review posts and decide which have crossed the line. They might even decide to ban a user who is being abusive and otherwise violating the terms of use.

These days, a better idea is to use AI agents who can do the task automatically and will not suffer the trauma of embarrassment or fatigue from dealing with difficult people.

## Agents

The first agent will read posts and flag any that seem to cross the line of decency, which is the primary vector of the terms of use.

Let's see how this goes. Other agents will follow.
